# Project Flight
## To get Started
1. Build the runtime (if needed)
2. Build the compiler
3. Use the compiler

## Different Directories
- ./src: Contains source code for the compiler
- ./build: where the compiler is built after running the makefile
- ./antlr4-runtime-Cpp: src code for the Antlr Runtime
- ./src/antlr4-grammar: Antlr generated header files for the ProjectFlight Grammar
- ./src/antlr4-runtime: Pre-built antlr4-runtime header files (from ./antlr4-runtime-Cpp)
- ./src/lib: Pre-built antlr4-runtime binary files (from ./antlr4-runtime-Cpp)
